Projects
======
* SLAM and exploration of a mobile robot, University of Michigan (Sept. 2021 - Oct. 2021)
  * Programmed a mobile robot to perform SLAM and exploration tasks (First place in the contest out of 24 teams)
  * Implemented Monte Carlo Localization with sensor readings from a RPLidar, wheel encoders, and a gyroscope
  * Implemented Frontier Exploration with A-star algorithm for the robot (Fully explored the maze in the competition)
  * Reduced position errors from 90 cm t0 3 cm when commanding the robot to drive a 1m square 8 times

* Autonomous blocks stacking robotics arm, University of Michigan (Oct. 2021 - Dec. 2021)
  * Programmed a robotics arm to autonomously identify and manipulate blocks (First place in the contest out of 24 teams)
  * Conducted camera intrinsic and extrinsic calibration using OpenCV PnP solver (with 4mm maximum depth error)
  * Developed an algorithm that utilizes a RGBD camera to detect blocks’ size, color, position, orientation on a board
