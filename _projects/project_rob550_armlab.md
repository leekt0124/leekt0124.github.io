Detail
======

* **Autonomous blocks stacking robotics arm**, University of Michigan (Oct. 2021 - Dec. 2021)
  * Programmed a robotics arm to autonomously identify and manipulate blocks (**First place** in the contest out of 24 teams)
  * Conducted camera intrinsic and extrinsic calibration using OpenCV PnP solver (with 4mm maximum depth error)
  * Developed an algorithm that utilizes a RGBD camera to detect blocksâ€™ size, color, position, orientation on a board
  * Implemented Forward / Inverse Kinematics and fine-tuned a PID controller (reduced offset from 20mm to 3mm)
